				<p><span class="sans">Mac or PC?</span> I use a Mac.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">In your opinion, what is the best browser for web fonts?</span> In my experience, Firefox has flaunted the best support for web fonts, especially OpenType features. That&#8217;s changing, though, and Safari remains my browser of choice.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What makes you cringe when looking at type on the web?</span> Mostly inconsistencies in typesetting and misunderstanding in typography. Long line lengths, tall or shrunken line-heights, and oversized text are the usual offenders. Also, it&#8217;s a small thing, but I can&#8217;t help but cringe a little when &#8220;dumb&#8221; quotes and apostrophes are used in place of curly quotes. Basic understanding of type seems to be missing from a lot of web designers&#8217; tool kits.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What is one thing you would like other web and graphic designers to know about web fonts?</span> Optimization is a key theme I think a lot of web designers forget about when using web fonts. It’s also often forgotten that we should see how our sites look when fonts fail to load, etc.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">How are webfonts contributing to brand development on multi media devices?</span> Web fonts mean that established brands can have some brand consistency between web and print. Many popular fonts are becoming available for use on the web, which is great!</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What makes a great webfont worth purchasing?</span> For me, it&#8217;s ligatures, true small caps, and multiple numeral options (lining, table, and old-style) that make a font worth buying.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">Do you know what hinting is, if so, in your words what does hinting do?</span> As far as I&#8217;m concerned, hinting is the aligning of type to the pixel grid, making it appear better at various sizes. This can either be done manually or by automation.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">How much coffee do you consume on a daily basis?</span> It varies, but I&#8217;d say an average of 2–3 cups a day.</p>
