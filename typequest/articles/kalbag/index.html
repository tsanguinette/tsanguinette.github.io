				<p><span class="sans">Mac or PC?</span> Mac</p>
				<p><span class="sans">You are obviously very busy with client work. How do you stay current with all the new <span class="smcp">w3c</span> standards especially on Web type?</span> I very rarely look at <span class="smcp">w3c</span> standards specifically, as they can be difficult and time-consuming to understand. This means that I get the majority of my information by closely following people who are far smarter (and often closer to the technology) than I am. This is often just through Twitter, but also through <span class="smcp">rss</span> feeds and attending web/typography conferences. I find the blogs of web font services also very useful in better understanding the platform&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">How do you discuss purchasing webfonts with clients? Are they reluctant? Do they understand the importance of having higher quality typography?</span> When I&#8217;m thinking about purchasing webfonts for clients, I take it on a case-by-case basis. If I think the client is likely to understand the importance of good quality typography, then I will discuss options with them and happily explain what a difference good typefaces can make. If I think they may be reluctant to pay for good typefaces, I will most often pay for the typefaces out of my own business costs, because I believe good typography is integral to good web design.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">Do you or have you used Font Squirrel for creating webfonts?</span> I’ve used Font Squirrel in the past. I have a lot of admiration for the concept of spreading good quality web fonts, and their generator is a very useful tool for optimizing existing fonts.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What is your type foundry of choice?</span> This is a tricky one! At the moment I love HVD Fonts.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What is one thing you would like other web and graphic designers to know about webfonts?</span> Not all web fonts are created equal! It&#8217;s well worth researching fonts that have been designed to work well on the screen, and checking how they render on multiple platforms before purchasing.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">Do you know what hinting is, if so, in your words what does hinting do?</span> I believe I do know what hinting is… Hinting ensures that the characters in a font render sharply on a display. The highest quality fonts tend to have been manually hinted to check that the characters are clean and crisp at many different sizes and weights.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">If you had extra time in general what would you focus on?</span> If I had extra time I would focus on improving the depth of my knowledge in subjects around web design. At the moment I particularly want to learn more about JavaScript and cognitive psychology.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">How much coffee or tea do you consume on a daily basis?</span> None! I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of coffee or tea. Until a couple of months ago I was addicted to high sugar energy drinks, but I&#8217;m now 100% caffeine-free!</p>
