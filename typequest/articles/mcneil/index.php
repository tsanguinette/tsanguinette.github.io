				<p><span class="sans">Mac or PC?</span> Both, but mostly <span class="smcp">pc</span>.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">In your opinion, what is the best browser for web fonts?</span> Chrome I guess. It is my preferred browser overall.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What makes you cringe when looking at type on the web?</span> When designers apply drop shadows to small text (especially body text) and it is literally impossible to read on a <span class="smcp">pc</span>.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What makes a great webfont worth purchasing?</span> I have never purchased one. It would have to be awesome, most likely a nice set of varying weights.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">Do you know what hinting is, if so, in your words what does hinting do?</span> My understanding is that it is extra info built into the font to help it render properly.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">How much coffee do you consume on a daily basis?</span> At least 1 pot a day :)</p>
