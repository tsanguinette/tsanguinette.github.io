				<p><span class="sans">How has the type industry as a whole adapted/handled the high demand and use of webfonts? Are production and skill set costs increasing?</span> I think the type industry has been waiting for webfonts for a long time, but they&#8217;ve only recently been fully supported by browsers. I think web designers have adapted their designs to the demand of clients who want a consistent typographic voice across all medium, and type designers have adapted with optimized files for hinting and file size to improve performance and reduce load time.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What can be improved with webfonts currently?</span> I think the biggest challenge right now is the discrepancy in pricing. There has to be a way to scale the cost, and traditionally this has been on the number of domains, number of page views, and number of years under a subscription model. But Google Fonts are fairly-well made and completely free, and TypeKit is pretty good and almost free. That threatens to undermine higher quality manually-hinted fonts from foundries like WebType, H&FJ, Commercial Type and others that are charging prices more in line with licensing costs for print fonts.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What makes a webfont or webfont hosting service worth purchasing?</span> The difference between manual and auto hinting can be subtle, but can cause problems with consistency across multiple styles in a family (x-heights, stem weights, overshoot, etc) across all OS and browsers.</p>
<p>Another consideration is technical support and whether the fonts are server-hosted or self-hosted. Server-hosted have the benefit of delivering different files based on the operating system and browser of the end-user.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">From your experience, what are some of the complications of producing webfonts?</span> Hinting and file size are the biggest ones. There was a long time where there wasn&#8217;t a standard for file format, and then we settled on <span class="smcp">woff</span>. But now it seems that there may be a preference for <span class="smcp">ttf</span> or even <span class="smcp">otf</span> files.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What is one important thing you would like web and graphic designers to know about webfonts?</span> That they still take time and skill to make, and should be paid for!</p>
				<p>I think it&#8217;s actually all very encouraging though. Now the interactive experience can be just as rich as the print experience, and it&#8217;s much easier to track usage, whereas tracking unlicensed usage of print fonts is still impossible.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">Which operating system(s) do you use?</span> Mac OS X Mavericks.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">How much coffee do you consume on a daily basis?</span> 3&ndash;4 cups.</p>
