				<p><span class="sans">Mac or PC?</span> At Sparkbox, we use Macs exclusively. They are super friendly to developers, their hardware is unbeatable, and their interface design is gorgeous, so for us it&#8217;s a given. Most of us run Windows on a virtual machine, though—so we&#8217;re able to test sites locally on Internet Explorer and other Windows browsers.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">In your opinion, what is the best browser for web fonts?</span> There isn&#8217;t really a &#8220;best browser&#8221; for viewing webfonts. Most modern web browsers have great web-font support, and render beautifully. There are some that aren&#8217;t good, though. Opera Mini, for example, doesn&#8217;t support @font-face, so your options for making sites look great on that browser are a lot more limited.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What makes you cringe when looking at type on the web?</span> It&#8217;s the little things. Taking the time to tweak line-height and letter-spacing isn&#8217;t difficult, but it can make a world of difference in the overall feeling of the site.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What is one thing you would like other web and graphic designers to know about web fonts?</span> Be sure to check out the greatest thing that&#8217;s happened to web-fonts recently: cloud.typography from H&FJ: <a href="http://www.typography.com/">typography.com</a>. They set the bar for gorgeous web-fonts, and the admin interface is super simple and fun to work with.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">How are webfonts contributing to brand development on multi media devices?</span> Web-fonts give designers the freedom to get creative with their designs, yet still build sites that are lean and semantic. That being said, web-fonts certainly are not a license to load up a page with a dozen typefaces just because you can. Treat custom fonts like a delicacy—consume sparingly and wisely.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">What makes a great webfont worth purchasing?</span> Character support and attention to detail.</p>
				<p><span class="sans">Do you know what hinting is, if so, in your words what does hinting do?</span> Nick Sherman says it best on A List Apart: &#8220;...hinting is to fonts what responsive layout is to websites. It allows a single font file to adapt to a variety of contexts...&#8221;</p>
				<p><span class="sans">How much coffee do you consume on a daily basis?</span> A lot. There&#8217;s always a pot brewing here in the office, so I help myself.</p>
