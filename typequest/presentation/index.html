							When people hear "type" or "typography" they usually think of Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, something decorative such as this. When in reality type is something much more detailed, skilled and advanced.

							Type designers are a highly skilled group inside the world of typography that makes typographic systems. They start out by creating individual letterforms and then

					<aside class="notes">
						Typefaces have always been physical like wood type or a printed document but now there is a new area of type evolving because of the web.

				<section data-background="#6CE867">
					<h2 class="white">Typography</br> &amp; the Web</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						I wanted to have a project that brought the Web and Type together so I had to find a middle ground that intersected both of these categories.

					<h2>Educate</br>&amp; Promote</h2>
					<p>Web Designers, Web Developers &amp; Graphic Designers.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Graphic Designers are expected to be familiar with coding languages because its helpful when making principle decisions for websites and apps. Since webfonts are fairly new I figured there would be a ton to learn and it relates directly to basic print typography which every designer or developer should be familiar with.
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Fonts</br>Formatted</br>For the Web</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Webfonts are just fonts formatted for the web and can come in many forms: OT, EOT (Embedded OpenType), WOFF and SVG. The main difference is basically compression, structure and browser support.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#6CE867">
					<h2 class="white big">Sexy</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						When looking for a good webfont you want to find a sexy one. And by sexy I mean small in file size (compression) & loaded with extra characters. That is if you are going to use them.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition-speed="fast">
					<h2>Junk in</br>the trunk.</h2>
					<p>Extended characters such as ligatures, real fractions, stylistic sets, small caps, etc.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						These extra characters are known as OT features. They enhance type legibility and give greater typographic layout controls. The features include ligatures, fractions, stylistic sets, smalls caps and many other.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3 class="center padding"><span class="noliga">ff fi fj fl ffi</span></h3>
						<h3 class="center"><span class="liga">ff fi fj fl ffi</span></h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							These are some of the most basic examples of OT features. The top row shows general characters without the ligature OT features activated and the bottom set is activated.
						</aside>

						<h3 class="center"><span class="onum">01234567890</span></h3>
						<h3 class="center"><span class="smcp">small caps</span></h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							On top we have a different style of numbers called Old-style followed by real small caps on the bottom. Everyone is probably saying “This seems basic so why does this matter?” Well you’ll find out in a minute but in short its LIVE TEXT — not a PNG or a JPEG!

					<h2 class="white">Control</br>&amp; use of</br>features</br>on the web</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						So we know that webfonts can have OT features, now what? As designers and developers we like control especially over fine details. The big question is "How do we use these features on the web?”.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>You couldn't</br>until recently!</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Its sad but we couldn't control these features on the web until recently.

					<section data-background="#6CE867">
						<h2 class="white big">CSS3</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							But thanks to the advancements in experimental CSS properties, type control is becoming widely addressed in the world of web development.
						</aside>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<p>* Experimental and in the working Editor’s Draft.</p>
						<h2>font</br>feature</br>settings*</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							The experimental property I’m going to focus on is the font feature settings. When I say experimental I mean it is in the Editor’s Draft of the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and not currently a recommendation.

					<section>
						<img width="800" height="300" src="images/code.jpg" alt="CSS Code">
						<p>Yes, you will need browser prefixes!</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							The code is relatively simple because it uses the existing OT tags as used by type designers when creating OT data structures. The website I created to showcase the features has a couple different sections. The first section displays the features next to its CSS code.
						</aside>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<img src="images/experts.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							It also has a section where I asked leading experts questions relating to web type and basically any helpful knowledge on the subject. Finally there is a blog section where I discuss and share additional findings on the topic. There can be a lot of weird and specific things that can happen when using webfonts so this section addresses those issues.
							
						</aside>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<img src="images/github.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							In addition to displaying and promoting OT features on the website, I created a LESS boilerplate on Github so developers and advanced coders could implement the features faster and with minimal code (because we all like short cuts).

					<h2 class="white">Leading Experts</br>Twitter</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						I have sent the website to all of the leading experts who participated so they can pass it along as a reference to others. I also created a Twitter account for the project because social media, especially Twitter, is a powerful tool in the design community. If you want little bits of helpful information follow the project @TypeQuestOT.

						Since the site’s “soft” launch in mid November, basically from word of mouth, I have had 228 visits and over 1,654 page views; 122 of those visitors were referred and 106 were direct. (It has been indexed with both Google and Bing)
